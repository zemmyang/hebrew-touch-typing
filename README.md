## About The Project

Touch typing isn't something officialy learned in Israeli schools but we do
spend a lot of time typing. This site bridges that gap by teaching the correct
finger positions and incrementally introducing more and more keys.

Touch typing can dramatically improve your typing speed and free your mind from
staring at the keyboard. With it, typing becomes more natural.

### Credits

Many thanks to https://github.com/dlvhdr for the initial design and implementation. All I 
did was add dark mode and a way to hide the keyboard.
